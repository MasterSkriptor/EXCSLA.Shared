# Phase 1, Task 7: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions.DomainEventDispatcher

## Context
This task is part of Phase 1 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions.DomainEventDispatcher` project for the domain event dispatcher interfaces.

## Actions
1.  Move the domain event dispatcher interfaces (e.g., `IDomainEventDispatcher`) into `src/Core/EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions.DomainEventDispatcher/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions.DomainEventDispatcher.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This project must **only** contain interfaces for the domain event dispatcher.
- This project should depend on `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions`.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
