# Phase 1, Task 2: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions

## Context
This task is part of Phase 1 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions` project to hold the core domain interfaces and contracts.

## Actions
1.  Move core interfaces and contracts (e.g., for repositories, specifications, services) into `src/Core/EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This project must **only** contain interfaces and abstract classes. No concrete implementations are allowed.
- This project should depend on `EXCSLA.Shared.Core`.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
