# Phase 3, Task 3: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.AzureBlobService.Abstractions

## Context
This task is part of Phase 3 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.AzureBlobService.Abstractions` project for Azure Blob Storage interfaces.

## Actions
1.  Move Azure Blob abstractions (interfaces and contracts) into `src/Infrastructure/EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.AzureBlobService.Abstractions/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.AzureBlobService.Abstractions.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This project must **only** contain interfaces and abstract classes for Azure Blob Storage. No concrete implementations are allowed.
- This project should have no dependencies on other Infrastructure implementation projects.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
