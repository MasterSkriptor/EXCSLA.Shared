# Phase 2, Task 1: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Application

## Context
This task is part of Phase 2 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Application` project to hold application logic, such as command and query handlers.

## Actions
1.  Move command/query/handler patterns, the dispatcher, and application service abstractions into `src/Application/EXCSLA.Shared.Application/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Application.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This project should orchestrate domain logic but not contain it.
- It must depend on the `Core` layer abstractions (e.g., `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions`).
- It must **not** depend on the `Infrastructure` layer.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
