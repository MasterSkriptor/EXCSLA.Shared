# Phase 1, Task 5: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Specifications

## Context
This task is part of Phase 1 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Specifications` project for the specification pattern implementation.

## Actions
1.  Move the specification pattern implementation (e.g., `Specification<T>`, `AndSpecification<T>`, etc.) into `src/Core/EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Specifications/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Specifications.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This project should contain the general-purpose specification pattern implementation.
- This project should depend on `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions`.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
