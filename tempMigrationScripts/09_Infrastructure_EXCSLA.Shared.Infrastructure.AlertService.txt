# Phase 3, Task 1: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.AlertService

## Context
This task is part of Phase 3 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.AlertService` project to encapsulate the alert service implementation.

## Actions
1.  Move alert service implementation code into `src/Infrastructure/EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.AlertService/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.AlertService.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This project must **only** contain the concrete implementation of the alert service.
- It must depend on the `Application` layer and/or `Core.Abstractions` if an interface for the alert service exists there.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
