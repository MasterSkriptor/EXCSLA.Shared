# Phase 1, Task 1: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Core

## Context
This is the first step in Phase 1 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Core` project, which will serve as the foundational domain layer.

## Actions
1.  Move the base classes for Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, and Domain Events into `src/Core/EXCSLA.Shared.Core/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The new project must only contain the specified core domain base classes.
- The project must not have dependencies on any other new projects from this migration.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
