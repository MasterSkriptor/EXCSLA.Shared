# Phase 4, Task 1: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Tests

## Context
This task is part of Phase 4 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Tests` project to house unit tests for the `EXCSLA.Shared.Core` project.

## Actions
1.  Move or create tests for `EXCSLA.Shared.Core` into `tests/Core/EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Tests/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Tests.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This project must **only** contain tests for `EXCSLA.Shared.Core`.
- It must reference `EXCSLA.Shared.Core` and any necessary testing frameworks (e.g., NUnit, xUnit).
- The test project must build and all tests must pass.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
