# Phase 4, Task 4: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.Tests

## Context
This task is part of Phase 4 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create individual test projects for each `EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure` component.

## Actions
1.  For each `EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.*` project (e.g., `AlertService`, `AzureBlobService`, `SendGridEmailService`, `DomainEventDispatcher`), create a corresponding test project at `tests/Infrastructure/EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.*.Tests/`.
2.  Move or create relevant tests into these new project locations.
3.  Create a new `.csproj` file for each new test project.
4.  Update the solution file to include all new test projects.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each test project must **only** contain tests for its corresponding infrastructure component.
- Each test project must reference its corresponding `EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.*` project and any necessary testing frameworks.
- All newly created test projects must build and all their tests must pass.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
