# Phase 1, Task 4: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Core.GuardClauses

## Context
This task is part of Phase 1 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.GuardClauses` project for argument validation logic.

## Actions
1.  Move all guard clause extensions and related helpers into `src/Core/EXCSLA.Shared.Core.GuardClauses/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.GuardClauses.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This project should contain only static extension classes for guarding method arguments.
- This project should have no dependencies on other projects in the solution.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
