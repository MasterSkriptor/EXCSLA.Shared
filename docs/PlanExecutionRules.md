# Plan Execution Rules

## Branch
- All documentation migration and updates will be executed in the `dev` branch.

## Task Workflow
1. For each task/section:
   - Show the detailed plan for the task before starting.
   - Get user approval or answer any outstanding questions before beginning work.
2. During execution:
   - Document any issues encountered and tips to avoid them in the future.
   - Create an issues file named `ISSUES_{Phase}_{Task}.md` in the `Documentation` folder at the root.
3. Before pushing to GitHub:
   - Ensure the issues file for the task is created and up to date.
4. At the end of the plan:
   - Summarize all issues files and create a single summary document for future reference and implementation guidance.

## ISSUES File Location
- All `ISSUES_{Phase}_{Task}.md` files will be placed in the `Documentation` folder under the root directory.
