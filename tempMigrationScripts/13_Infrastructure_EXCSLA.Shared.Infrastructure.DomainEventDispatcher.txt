# Phase 3, Task 5: Create EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.DomainEventDispatcher

## Context
This task is part of Phase 3 of the migration. Refer to `00_Migration_Introduction.txt` for the overall goal and guiding principles.

## Task
Create the `EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.DomainEventDispatcher` project for the domain event dispatcher implementation.

## Actions
1.  Move domain event dispatcher implementation code into `src/Infrastructure/EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.DomainEventDispatcher/`.
2.  Create a new `EXCSLA.Shared.Infrastructure.DomainEventDispatcher.csproj` file in this directory.
3.  Update the solution file to include this new project.

## Acceptance Criteria
- This project must **only** contain the concrete implementation of the domain event dispatcher.
- It must depend on `EXCSLA.Shared.Core.Abstractions.DomainEventDispatcher`.
- The solution must build without errors after the changes.
