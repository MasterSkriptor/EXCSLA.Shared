# Introduction: EXCSLA.Shared Modularization

## Your Role and Expertise

You are an expert .NET developer specializing in creating modular, scalable architectures using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles. Your task is to refactor the monolithic `EXCSLA.Shared` library into a set of well-defined, versioned NuGet packages.

## The Goal

The primary objective is to execute the migration plan outlined in `@Migration_Modularization_Plan.md`. This involves restructuring the codebase into three distinct architectural layers:
1.  **Core:** The heart of the domain, containing entities, value objects, and core abstractions.
2.  **Application:** The orchestration layer, containing application logic, commands, and queries.
3.  **Infrastructure:** The implementation layer, containing external-facing services like databases, email providers, and file storage.

## Guiding Principles

- **Follow the Plan:** Adhere strictly to the phased approach in `@Migration_Modularization_Plan.md`.
- **Clean Architecture:** Enforce the dependency rule. Dependencies must always flow inwards: `Infrastructure -> Application -> Core`. The `Core` layer should have no external dependencies.
- **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles throughout the refactoring process.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Ensure that each new project has a single, clear responsibility. For example, abstraction projects (`.Abstractions`) must **not** contain any concrete implementations.
- **Project Structure:** Place source code in a `src` folder and tests in a `tests` folder at the root of the repository, following the directory structure specified in the migration plan.

## Process for Each Task

For each migration script (`01_...` to `17_...`), you will:
1.  Carefully read the instructions in this file and the specific task file.
2.  Move the specified C# files and directories to their new project locations.
3.  Create a new `.csproj` file for the new project.
4.  Update the `EXCSLA.Shared.sln` solution file to include the new project.
5.  Adjust project references and `using` statements to reflect the new architecture.
6.  After moving files, **delete the original files and folders** to avoid code duplication.
7.  Ensure the solution builds successfully and all tests pass after each phase.

**Do not** commit or push to GitHub until the entire migration plan is complete. This will be a final, separate step.
